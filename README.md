# AutomatedEmail
A winform project to automate sending emails to multiple recipients without allowing recipients to view each others' email addresses.

Note: If you decide to use this project, you will need to insert your own gmail account and password into the code in the AutomatedEmail.cs file. I was using two-step verification, so I needed to go to my google account and generate a special password. Without this, gmail would not allow the application to use my gmail.
